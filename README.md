# Veritas Training System (VTS)
**Developed by Diamond8522**

## Mission
VTS is a cross-platform VR training environment designed to bridge the gap between technical data and spatial learning. Originally conceived as a B2B solution for high-risk industrial safety (OSHA), it integrates the **Veritas Matrix** auditing logic into an immersive 3D GUI.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19
- **3D Engine:** React Three Fiber (Three.js)
- **Data Logic:** Python (Llama 3 / GPT-4o)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS / Framer Motion

## Current Objectives
1. Implement the "Spatial Dashboard" for real-time log auditing.
2. Port the 'Glitch Assistant' OCR logic to 3D text textures.
3. Establish the "Forest to Sea" environmental simulation.# Veritas-Training-System
